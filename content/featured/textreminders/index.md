As someone who held leadership positions in college, I always wished for a way to schedule-send iMessages, just like the capability of an email.

I made my wish come true with AppleScript. AppleScript allowed me to schedule send messages through iMessage, a scheduling engine, and the Google Sheets API. As the user, I used Google Sheets to select a contact, date, and write a message. It was pretty cool and it saved a lot of time!
